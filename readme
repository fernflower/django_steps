# in order to enable VK comments on developer's server you need to start server at 127.0.0.1:80. The best way I found (to avoid starting server as root) - start server at port 8080 and redirect traffic to port 80 by adding entries to iptables.

sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d localhost -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

# in order to set up email notifications (gmail) on message post you need to create file contacts/secret_settings.py and setup Gmail's login\password and send mail list. Something like the following:
#
MY_EMAIL_HOST_USER = "my_login"
MY_EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = "my_pass"
MY_EMAIL_RECIPIENT_LIST = ("notify_me1@site.com", "notify_me2@site.com", )
# all other settings (smtp port, smtp server etc are in mysite/settings.py as usual; those were moved out and .gitignored for obvious security reasons)
